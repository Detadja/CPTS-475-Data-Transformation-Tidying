# CPTS-475-Data-Transformation-Tidying

* This is a school project created in R. It takes three csv datasets, `WNBA_Stats_21.csv`, `who.csv`, and `SchQtr.csv`, and via tidying and transforming the data, finds more detailed information from the dataset than from a single glance. It then outputs the results either directly or via plots as well as creating a pdf output of the results via an Rmd file.

* Last updated on: 21st Sep 2022, as Assignment 3 for the course Cpts 475 - Data Science.

* This program was written in R. To run, import files to local system and run on R Studio.
